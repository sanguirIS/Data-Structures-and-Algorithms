1. Study the following sample Python syntaxes:
Task Sample Syntax Remarks
Variable declaration x = 5 No need to indicate the
data type. Do not add
semi-colon.
Comment #This is a comment.
User input name = input(“Enter your name”)
Convert string to
int or float.
int(x)
float(x)
Convert to compare or
compute values.
Convert int or float
to string.
str(x) Convert if the output must
show a number and a
string.
Combine conditional
statements.
x > 5 and x <10
x > 5 or x < 10
not(x < 5)
if statement if x == 0:
 print(“Enter a higher number”)
Use four (4) spaces per
indentation level.
else-if statement elif x == 0:
 print(“Enter a higher number”)
else statement else:
 print(“Try again”)
Create a list of items. my_list = [“red”, “blue”, “green”] Python recommends the
use of lists than arrays.
Display all items in a
list.
print(my_list)
Create an empty list. my_list = []
Add an item to the end
of a list.
my_list.append(“yellow”)
2. Open Notepad++.
3. Create a Python script that will compare two (2) numbers entered by the user. Refer to the sample
syntaxes and the algorithm below.
3.1. User enters the first number.
3.2. User enters the second number.
3.3. If the first number is less than, greater than, or equal the second number, a message is
displayed.
4. Save the script as algo1.py.
5. To test and run the script, open Command Prompt. Navigate to your file’s location then type python
algo1.py.
6. Create another Python script that will display the names of your three (3) classmates. Refer to the
sample syntaxes and algorithm below.
6.1. User enters the name of the first classmate.
6.2. User enters the name of the second classmate.
6.3. User enters the name of the third classmate.
6.4. The name of the three (3) classmates are displayed.
7. Save the script as algo2.py.
8. Create a folder named LastName_FirstName_MI_LE1 (ex. Reyes_Nika_P_LE1) in your local drive.
9. Move the two (2) scripts to your folder.
