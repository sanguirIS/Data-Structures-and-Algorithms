1. Using this online IDE, create a Python script with a recursive function to display the sum of the first n integers, where n is entered by the user. There is no need to create a class similar to how Java works. 

2. Name your function find_sum. 

3. Upload the .py file and a screenshot of your output.

Sample output:

Enter a number: 5

The sum of the first 5 integers is 15.

Explanation: Because the user entered 5, the first 5 integers are added. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.
